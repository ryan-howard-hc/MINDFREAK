Should take a number without being input, and while doing basic mathematics should produce a symbol that corresponds to the number. Should take the experience working with the alarm clock to manipulating the current state of the page.
## BEGIN

## VARIABLES
- a state function -> controls the variables that create a page and structure
    - 
- a render function -> controls the variables that make the pages scroll as well as creating the outcome symbol
